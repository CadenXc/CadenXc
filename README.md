# 👋 Hi, I'm CadenXc!

🎮 I'm a beginner in **Open Source** and passionate about **Game Development**.  
🛠️ Currently learning **C++**, **Data Structures & Algorithms**, and exploring game development with **Godot**.  
🌱 I believe in the hacker spirit — learning by doing, breaking things, and sharing my knowledge with others.  
🚀 My goal is to contribute to open-source projects, improve my skills, and eventually work in game development.
